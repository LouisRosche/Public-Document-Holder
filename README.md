LSC's Leadership Competencies rubric is our shared description of the mindsets and behaviors that are critical for success at LSC. Staff members and managers use the rubric as they engage in meaningful and productive conversations about development and progression in the organization, whether in formal settings such as the staff development cycle or in informal settings like check-ins or coaching conversations. 
The rubric groups the competencies in five clusters: 
Foundational Competencies 
Driving Results 
Relationships 
Leading Others 
Program Knowledge 
Within each cluster, each individual competency includes a description of the behaviors and actions that a leader who is proficient in the competency would demonstrate. The description has separate categories by position-level, allowing team members and their managers to share a common understanding of the benchmarks for current performance and what it will take to move into positions of greater responsibility.
